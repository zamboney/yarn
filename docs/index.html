                ##From NPM to Yarn



                ###what is NPM


                **NPM** stand for "**N**ode **P**ackage **M**anger" and it's come to handle node modules, from a remote and local repository, so that can distributed to other developers


                NPM isn't the only package manger system, there is a lot other like:
                - PIP for python
                - Nuget for C#
                - JSM for Java
                - etc...


                The default repository that NPM set out of the box is https://registry.npmjs.org, and his site is https://www.npmjs.com

                (in this we will use a local repository call [**sinopia**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sinopia) but this is out of scope)



                ###Create and Publish Packages


                #### `package.json`
                * the manifest of each package is `package.json` file.
                * this file contain the metadata of the package.
                * the metadata contain a lot of properties, like name, version, description and etc... of the package.
                * we will focus on `dependencies` property.


                to create a `package.json` file run `npm init`, this will start to ask you question about you package and place them in the file

                (also know commend is `npm init -f`, this will auto replay the question and just create the `package.json`)


                #### package.json `dependencies` (1/2)
                * this property list the **dependencies** of this package.
                * it's a key value object:
                    * the key represent the name of the the package
                    * the value is the version of the package.
                * the version system known as [`semver.inc`](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#prerelease-tags)


                #### package.json `dependencies` (2/2)
                * there are types of dependencies like `devDependencies` and `peerDependencies` (out of this lecture scope).
                * add a new dependency to the package by running `npm install < package-name > --save`.
                * installing the dependencies by running `npm install` on the folder that contain the `package.json`


                #### package.json `dependencies` example
                ```
                    {
                        "name": "guessing-game-ui",
                        "version": "1.0.0",
                        "description": "",
                        "main": "index.js",
                        "author": "",
                        "license": "ISC",
                        "dependencies": {
                            "guessing-game-logic": "^1.0.1"
                        }
                    }
                ```


                #### Publish package (1/2)
                1. create an account in the repository (per repertory out of scope), done once per account.
                2. register the account in the machine, done once per machine.
                    * run `npm adduser` and enter the username and password.


                #### Publish package (2/2)
                3. `npm publish`.
                    * this command upload the package to the repertory.
                    * package wouldn't upload if there is another package with the same **name and version**.
                    * to solve this use `npm version major | minor | patch | etc..`. this will update the version by the argument. then use `npm publish`.


                ### DEMO



                ## `yarn` introduction.


                ### What is `yarn`?
                * `yarn`,just like `npm`, is a JavaScript package manger.
                * `yarn` come to solve same issues that `npm` have.
                * `yarn` can use `npm` repositories (so no need to create new repository just for `yarn`)
                * develop by **Facebook** with **Google**


                ### Why using `yarn`?
                * more fast.
                * more reliable.
                * more secure.


                ### Start using `yarn`.
                1. download nodejs and `npm`.
                2. run (as administrator) `npm install --global yarn`.
                3. run `yarn --version`.
                4. that it! ([for more info](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install))


                ### `npm` vs `yarn` commands

                | NPM | YARN |
                | ----| ---- |
                |`npm install`| `yarn`|
                |`npm install rxjs --save`| `yarn add rxjs`|
                |`npm uninstall rxjs --save`| `yarn remove rxjs`|
                |`npm install rxjs --global`| `npm install rxjs --global`|
                |`npm update --save`| `yarn upgrade`|


                ### `npm`, `yarn` common commands
                * `init`
                * `publish`
                * `run`
                * `cache clean`
                * `login`
                * `test`



                ## Why `yarn` fast.


                `npm install` is a long process.
                the reason for that is that `npm install` work one by one (download and build one package at a time).

                also `npm` have a cache mechanism, `npm install` must have an internet connection to get the package dependencies.


                `yarn` doesn't work like `npm`.

                `yarn` download the dependencies parallel and store all of them in a cache folder that reachable offline.

                * once `yarn` call
                * for dependencies that **hasn't** been cached, `yarn` will download them parallel, and store them in the cache folder.
                * for dependencies that **has** been cache, `yarn` will get them form the cache folder.


                ##[npm vs yarn speed test](https://github.com/appleboy/npm-vs-yarn)



                ## Why `yarn` reliable


                * hello



                ## Why `yarn` security


                * `npm` can execute file, after install, using the `{scripts : {install: < command> }}`.
                * this means that `yarn`, before execute this script, do a *"checksums"* with a *sha-1* that place in a parameter on the dependency `yarn.lock`.
                * so if someone will try to switch the dns and hack to a npm repository, yarn will know that cause the *sha-1* in the repository isn't the some in the `yarn.lock` file.
