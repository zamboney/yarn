                ##From NPM to Yarn
                #### Publish and Install Node Packages



                ###what is NPM?


                **NPM** stand for "**N**ode **P**ackage **M**anger" and it's come to handle node modules, from a remote repository, so that can distributed to other.


                NPM isn't the only package manger system, there is a lot other like:
                - PIP for python
                - Nuget for C#
                - JSM for Java
                - etc...


                The default repository that NPM set out of the box is https://registry.npmjs.org, and his site is https://www.npmjs.com

                (in this lecture we will use a local repository call [**sinopia**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sinopia))


                #### `sinopia`
                sinopia is a local npm registry. this means that instead of publish and installing packages from `npmjs.org` this module will get them form the local file system

                [localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082)




                ###Create, Publish and Install Packages


                #### `package.json`
                * the manifest of each package is `package.json` file.
                * this file contain the metadata of the package.
                * the metadata contain a lot of properties, like name, version, description, **dependencies** and etc... of the package.


                to create a `package.json` file just run `npm init` in the command promote, this will start to ask you question about you package and place them in the file

                (`npm init -f` will auto replay the question and just create the `package.json`)


                ### DEMO1


                #### Publish package
                1. create an account in the repository.
                2. register the account in the machine.
                    * run `npm adduser` and enter the username and password.
                3. `npm publish`.
                    * package wouldn't upload if there is another package with the same **name and version**.
                    * to solve this use `npm version major | minor | patch | etc..`.


                ### DEMO2


                #### package.json `dependencies` (1/2)
                * this property define list of **dependencies** for the package.
                * it's a key value object:
                    * the key represent the name of the the package.
                    * the value is the version of the package.
                * the version system known as [`node semver.inc`](https://github.com/npm/node-semver).


                #### package.json `dependencies` (2/2)
                * there are other types of dependencies like `devDependencies` and `peerDependencies` (out of this lecture scope).
                * add a new dependency to the package by running `npm install <package-name> --save`.
                * installing the dependencies by running `npm install` on the folder that contain the `package.json`


                ### DEMO3


                ####node semver [advanced-range-syntax](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#advanced-range-syntax)
                * this method of visioning using to auto update the version of the package.
                * by using a `^` or `~` on the beginning of the `version` value the `node semver` will auto update the packages on the next `npm install`.
                    * `^1.2.3` `:=` `>=1.2.3 <2.0.0` (a.k.a. last minor update)
                    * `~1.2.3` `:=` `>=1.2.3 <1.3.0` (a.k.a. last patch update)
                * [read more](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#advanced-range-syntax)


                ### DEMO4



                ## `yarn` introduction.


                ### What is `yarn`?
                * `yarn`, just like `npm`, is a JavaScript package manger.
                * `yarn` solve some issues that `npm` have.
                * `yarn` can use `npm` repositories (so no need to create new repository just for `yarn`)
                * develop by **Facebook** with **Google**


                ### Why using `yarn`?
                * more fast.
                * more reliable.
                * ~~more secure~~.


                ### Start using `yarn`.
                1. download nodejs and `npm`.
                2. run (as administrator) `npm install --global yarn`.
                3. run `yarn --version`.
                4. that it! ([for more info](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install))


                ### `npm` vs `yarn` commands

                | NPM | YARN |
                | ----| ---- |
                |`npm install`| `yarn`|
                |`npm install rxjs --save`| `yarn add rxjs`|
                |`npm uninstall rxjs --save`| `yarn remove rxjs`|
                |`npm install rxjs --global`| `npm install rxjs --global`|
                |`npm update --save`| `yarn upgrade`|


                ### `npm`, `yarn` common commands
                * `init`
                * `publish`
                * `run`
                * `cache clean`
                * `login`
                * `test`


                ###DEMO5



                ## Why `yarn` fast.


                `npm install` is a long process. the reason for that is that `npm install` work one by one (download and build one package at a time).

                although `npm` have a cache mechanism, `npm install` must have an internet connection to get the package dependencies(**not working offline!**).


                `yarn` don't work like `npm`.

                `yarn` download the dependencies parallel and store all of them in a cache folder that reachable offline.

                * once `yarn` call
                * for dependencies that **hasn't** been cached, `yarn` will download them parallel, and store them in the cache folder.
                * for dependencies that **has** been cache, `yarn` will get them form the cache folder (**offline!**).

                ##[npm vs yarn speed test](https://github.com/appleboy/npm-vs-yarn)



                ## Why `yarn` reliable


                * `npm`, as mentioned before, using [`semver.inc`](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#prerelease-tags).
                * in `semver.inc` the upgrade done, according to the prefix, on every `npm install` command
                * this could create issues when trying to deliver the code or running it on remote machine (a.k.a. build machine)


                ###DEMO6


                `npm` have a special command that solve this called [`npm shrinkwrap`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/shrinkwrap).

                what it does is generates a file called `npm-shrinkwrap.json` that specific the version that uses in package and when running `npm install` it will download the correct versions.


                ###DEMO7


                `yarn` do this out of the box.

                every time `yarn add <package-name>` runs a file called `yarn.lock` generates that contain the metadata of the current package.

                so that the next running of `yarn` the `yarn` will know exactly what to download.


                ###DEMO8


                ## But Wait!

                this could be easily solved just by removing the prefix of the version number on the `package.json`...

                <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                that is true but then the functionality of `npm update` will not work!

                <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->



                ## Is `yarn` Secure?


                > Mega Secure.
                >
                > Yarn uses checksums to verify the integrity of every installed package before its code is executed.

                [https://yarnpkg.com](https://yarnpkg.com)


                this is an open issue on `yarn` [github](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/1169) that question this statement.


                the questions that still didn't get answer are:
                * how does yarn use cryptographic hashes to ensure that packages are unmodified?
                * when are hashes generated and when are they compared?
                * why was the SHA1 hash chosen, when more modern and secure primitives such as SHA256 are recommended by security experts?
                * etc...


                the real difficultly, yarn having, is that they relay on npm.

                * npm use SHA1, so yarn must use SHA1 for npm packages.
                * etc..



                ##Conclusions


                ### `yarn` Pros
                * using `yarn` will defiantly increase the speed of develop and deployment.
                * `yarn` will sync your package so that "*work on my computer*" issues will defiantly decrease.
                * no need to remember using spacial flags like `--save` and `npm shrinkwrap` `yarn` do it for you.


                ### `yarn` Cons
                * `yarn` is in his very early state and when starting to work with it you will get some wired behaviors.
                * developers that using `npm` command will get very annoyed to switch to this similar but different syntax.
                * using a proxy to tunnel for the repository will always be a bad practice.
